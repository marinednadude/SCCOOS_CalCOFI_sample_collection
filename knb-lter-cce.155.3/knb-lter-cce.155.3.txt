    Derived dataset of spring annual averages of abundance of sentinel euphausiid species (Euphausia pacifica, Nyctiphanes simplex and Nematoscelis difficilis) since 1951 (ongoing).  Zooplankton are collected in net tows and enumerated by major taxa from spring CalCOFI cruises (lines 80-93, inclusive of stations from shore out to station 70). Original data are from the zooplankton dataspace, specifically the Brinton-Townsend Euphausiid Database.

            General Methods
            The euphausiid data are based on night tows only. Spring annual averages are from samples usually taken in April but may vary from February to May. The net tows were double oblique. Over time, the net tows changed from a CalCOFI ring net to 140m, with 1m net mouth diameter and 0.55 mm net mesh (C1s; 1951-1968) to a CalCOFI ring net to 210m depth with 1m net mouth diameter and 0.505 mm net mesh (C1n; 1969-1977), to a CalCOFI bongo to 210m depth with 0.71 net mouth diameter and 0.505 mm net mesh (CB; 1977- present; see Ohman and Smith 1995). Sampling characteristics (see code controlled vocabulary for zooplankton sampling characteristics: http://oceaninformatics.ucsd.edu/datazoo/resources/controlledvocabularies?action=set&id=194).The sample preservative is sodium tetraborate-buffered formaldehyde.
